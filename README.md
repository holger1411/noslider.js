# noslider.js
The best slider script in the world!

All UX designer around the globe agree in one point: No slider is the best slider.
Thats why I create noslider.js

The best of all:
- It comes with no code, really. Nada. Not 1 byte
- You don´t need npm, bower, a CDN or anything else to implement it and to run it.
- You dont need to add any code or script
- Just don´t use a slider and you are good to go
- The noslider.js build never fails
- There was NEVER a bug in it
- No security problems
- No bored site visitors
- 0% perfomrance impact on your page load
- Google love it!
- Works with jQuery, mootools, dojo. Is compatible with YUI
- Supports even Angular 2!


## Installation
Don´t do anything. Really. Nothing
If you really want type into your terminal:
`npm install nosliderjs`

You might see an error message. Ignore this.
