# noslider.js
The best slider script in the world! Makes sliding around GREAT AGAIN!

All UX designer´s around the globe agree: The best slider is NO SLIDER.
Thats why I create noslider.js

The best of all:
- Works in all browser´s on all OS. Even Opera Mobil on your Xbox in quirks mode support this!
- You don´t need npm, bower, a CDN or anything else to implement it and to run it.
- You dont need to add any code or script.
- The noslider.js build never fails.
- There was NEVER a bug in it.
- No security problems.
- No bored site visitors.
- 0% performance impact on your page load.
- Google love it!
- Works with jQuery, mootools, dojo and ANY JS framework on this planet. There are just a few YUI issues...
- Supports even Angular, Angular 2 & React!
- Wordks with WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and any other CMS. To plugin or modul installation is needed.
- Used by huge companies like Nike & Coke 


## Installation
Don´t do anything. Really. Nothing. Just DON´T USE A SLIDER.

If you really need some sort of install routine or dependency management (to feel better as full stack developer) type this into your terminal:

`npm install nosliderjs`

or

`bower install nosliderjs`

or

`please install nosliderjs`

You might see an error message. Ignore this. You are good to go.
