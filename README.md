# noslider.js
The best slider script in the world! Makes sliding around GREAT AGAIN!

All UX designer´s around the globe agree: The best slider is NO SLIDER.
Thats why I create noslider.js

The best of all:
- Works in all browser´s on all OS. Even Opera Mobil on your Xbox in quirks mode support this!
- You don´t need npm, bower, a CDN or anything else to implement it and to run it.
- You dont need to add any code or script.
- The noslider.js build´s never fails.
- There was NEVER a bug in it.
- No security problems.
- No bored site visitors.
- No performance impact on your page load! Any page speed tool loves noslider.js!
- Google love it, too!
- Works with jQuery, mootools, dojo and ANY JS framework on this planet. There are just a few YUI issues...
- Supports other popular JS frameworks out-of-the-box! Even Angular, Angular 2 & React implement it already!
- Works with WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and any other CMS. No plugin or modul installation is needed because it is already build into the core of all this cool open source projects.
- Used by huge companies like Nike & Coke. Just Apple don´t get it... 


## Installation
Don´t do anything. Really. Nothing. Just DON´T USE A SLIDER.

If you really need some sort of install routine or dependency management (to feel better as the full stack developer you are) type this into your terminal:

`npm install nosliderjs`

or

`bower install nosliderjs`

or

`please install nosliderjs`

You might see an error message. Ignore this. You are good to go now.
